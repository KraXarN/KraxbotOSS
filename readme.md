# About
A Steam chat bot based off KraxBot 3.0, but uses a different programming language, so not really.
Why? To make it easier to run for other users and to provide a simple GUI.

# Features

The bot has a lot of different features! Here are some of them:

* Sending messages between a Discord channel and a Steam chatroom
* Spam protection
* Link resolving for YouTube, Steam etc.
* Cleverbot (With Cleverbot.IO)
* Rules
* Keeping different settings for different chatrooms
* Runs on Windows, Linux and macOS
* And more!

# Pre-Built Executables
Check the releases page. Currently, some manual steps are required to run it on Linux and macOS. If enough people are intrested in running it on those systems, I might make special executables for them.

# Compiling yourself
Clone it and open `KraxBotOSS.sln` in your favourite IDE and hit build. Recommended is Visual Studio 2017.

# Running on Windows
Just open `KraxbotOSS.exe`. If that doesn't work, make sure you have .NET 4.6.2 installed,
If you don't, you can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345)

# Running on Linux/Mac
Check the wiki, Mac should be similar to Linux.

# Versioning
Like KraxBot, every 1.x update will bring new features and every 1.x.x update will either extend one of the current features or just be a bug fix.
